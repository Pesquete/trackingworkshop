# trackingworkshop
This repository holds the R code and sample data from my workshop on analyzing telemetry data in R

1. Formatting data & basic mapping
2. Creating trajectories
3. Home ranges with minimum convex polygons
4. Home ranges with kernel density estimators
5. Functions to make 95% kernel contour area equal to the 100% minimum convex polygon area
6. Applying the functions to make 95% kernel contour area equal to the 100% minimum convex polygon area
